Something A little about whitehat jr and me! WhitehatJr is a awesome 1 on 1 private coding lesson on the computer! 
You get projects after classes to improve your skills and make your way into Entrepreneurship!
Some thing about me are, I love to play video games and hoping to make a little cash from streaming. Yet I still dont have a gaming pc yet. 
I'm hoping to get one from the cash I make from developing games! I have a family of 5 including me and I'm going back to hybrid school learning!
